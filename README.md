# Equine Integration feedback improvement project
This Flutter project was created based on designs me and my team worked on during our Advanced Media semester. 

## Purpose of the project
With this project, we wanted to make the feedback equestrians get to see after measuring their trainings more understandable for them. Our solution: new Flutter in-app pages, a watch application and a widget extension for both iOS and Android.

## My contribution for this project
I focused on developing the smartphone widget for iOS devices with Swift and worked on the in-app ribbon collection page and monthly recap pop up with Flutter. Therefore, I improved my Swift development skills and also learned a new framework: Flutter.
